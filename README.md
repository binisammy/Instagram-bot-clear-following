# Instagram bot to see users not following you back (2023 SAFE MODE)

Have you ever had the curiosity to know which profiles are not following you back?
You're in the right place.
This simple script can do that without getting your account suspended or banned.

## Instructions

1. Log in to your Instagram account via Firefox. (I suggest you to use a new Instagram account cause this account will make some bot stuff and Instagram might shadow-ban it)
2. Now execute the python script "import_firfox_session.py" and then you should get this line on your terminal "Imported session cookie for "your-bot-account""
3. Now open the igBot.py file and assign to the USER variable your bot account (the same you logged-in on Firefox) and assign to the PROFILE variable the account username you want to check its following list (IMPORTANT: if the PROFILE account privacy is set to private, USER account must follow PROFILE account)
4. Execute igBot.py and after a while you should have a new file in your folder named "notFollowingBack.txt". There you can find all the people who are not following you back!
